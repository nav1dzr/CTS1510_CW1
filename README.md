# 📘 CTS1510 Coursework 2 – Python Portfolio (Weeks 1–5)

This repository contains my **Python learning portfolio** for the CTS1510 module.  
The entire portfolio is presented inside **one Jupyter Notebook**, where each week is clearly labelled and includes:

- The weekly lab activity from the worksheet  
- My own portfolio version of the task  
- A membership registration app (Week 1)  
- Improved versions of the membership app (Weeks 2–4)  
- A short reflection paragraph at the end of each week  

The notebook shows my progress in Python from Week 1 to Week 5.
